# First Last - M1 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

What did you set out to accomplish this module? Were you successful?

I set out to update and sharpen my back end coding skills. I also set to get better at assessments. I think I have definitely accomplished those goals within the scope of what's taught in this module. I can say that I learned more this second time around. I am a stronger developer.

What did you struggle most with this module? What did you learn from that struggle?

I struggled the most with independent challenges because of time constraint mostly. I learned that I need to improve my typing skills. I have gotten better but need to keep practicing to get where I want to be.


## Projects

What were your favorite projects this module? Least favorite? Why?

My favorite projects for this module were Enigma and Battleship again. I loved the challenge of building both projects. Working through Enigma by myself was a good confirmation of my improved skills. I wrote better code faster. I enjoyed Battleship because I had a very skilled partner and our collaboration resulted in an excellent implementation of Battleship.

What did you learn from your independent projects?

- Time management
- Design
- Finish your project and then refactor.


What did you learn from your paired projects?

- Team work is not always easy. But I also have to be able to adapt to working with different personalities.
- Two heads can solve problems better than just one.
- Pairing

## Community

How did you contribute to the Turing community this module?

I contributed to the Turing community by helping classmates when they had questions about work or projects. I also contributed by being friendly and connecting with those who seem to have a hard time building new relationships. I was also supportive and offered encouragement to classmates.

What would you like to do to contribute next module?

I would like to pair with students from lower mods and help them out.
